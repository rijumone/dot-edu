Japan

Japan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar
accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of
iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac.
