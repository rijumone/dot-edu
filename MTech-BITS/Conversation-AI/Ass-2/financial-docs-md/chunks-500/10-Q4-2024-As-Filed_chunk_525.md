Contingencies

The Company  is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that
have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at
least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
