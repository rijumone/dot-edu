How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit

We  tested  controls  relating  to  the  evaluation  of  uncertain  tax  positions,  including  controls
over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be
sustained,  management’s  process  to  measure  the  benefit  of  its  tax  positions,  and  the
development of the related disclosures.
