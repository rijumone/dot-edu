The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates.  The  use  of  such  hedging  activities  may  not  be  effective  to  offset  any,  or  more  than  a
portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are
in place.
