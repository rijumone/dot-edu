The Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair
value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.
