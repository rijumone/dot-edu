“Nonpublic” Information

“Nonpublic” information means information that has not been previously disclosed to the general
public and is otherwise not available to the general public. Information should be considered nonpublic
for at least 24 hours after it has been distributed to the general public through a press release, filing
with the SEC, or similar means. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media,
is not considered effective public distribution.
