While  the  Company  maintains  insurance  coverage  for  certain  types  of  claims,  such  insurance  coverage  may  be  insufficient  to
cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

The  Company  is  subject  to  complex  and  changing  laws  and  regulations  worldwide,  which  exposes  the  Company  to
potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Companyâ€™s business.
