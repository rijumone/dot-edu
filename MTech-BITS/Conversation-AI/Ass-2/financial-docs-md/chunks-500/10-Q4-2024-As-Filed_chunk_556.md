How We Addressed the
Matter in Our Audit

We  tested  controls  relating  to  the  evaluation  of  uncertain  tax  positions,  including  controls
over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be
sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for
recognition, and the related disclosures.
