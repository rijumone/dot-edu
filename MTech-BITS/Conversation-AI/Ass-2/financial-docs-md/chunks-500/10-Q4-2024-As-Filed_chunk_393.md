Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538
million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying
foreign  currency  exposures,  which  were  excluded  from  the  assessment,  generally  offset  changes  in  the  fair  values  of  the
Company’s foreign currency derivatives.
