Vacancies created by the removal of a director must be filled only by approval of the shareholders, or by the

unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote. The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a
vacancy not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by
removal, requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.
