The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost
of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that
include  components  obtained  from  foreign  suppliers  have  in  the  past  been  adversely  affected  and  could  in  the  future  be
materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
