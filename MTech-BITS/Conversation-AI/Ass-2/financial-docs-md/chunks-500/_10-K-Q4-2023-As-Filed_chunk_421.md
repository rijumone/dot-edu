For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that
any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.
