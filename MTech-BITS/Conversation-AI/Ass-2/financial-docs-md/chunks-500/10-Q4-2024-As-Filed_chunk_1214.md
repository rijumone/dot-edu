With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be
an  equitable  and  proportionate  adjustment  to  the  extent  (if  any)  necessary  to  preserve  the  intended
incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split
occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable twenty (20)-day period in determining
Beginning Price or Ending Price, as the case may be).
