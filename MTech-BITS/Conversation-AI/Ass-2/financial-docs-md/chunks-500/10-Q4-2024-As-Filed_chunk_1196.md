For TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above,
the portion of the RSUs that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e.,
linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Companyâ€™s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in

no event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.
