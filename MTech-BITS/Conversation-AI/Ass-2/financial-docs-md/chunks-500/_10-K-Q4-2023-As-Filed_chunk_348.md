Services gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in
foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.

The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and
downward pressure.
