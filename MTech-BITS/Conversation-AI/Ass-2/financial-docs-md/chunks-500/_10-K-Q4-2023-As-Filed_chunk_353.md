The  Companyâ€™s  effective  tax  rate  for  2023  was  lower  compared  to  2022  due  primarily  to  a  lower  effective  tax  rate  on  foreign
earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially
offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
