The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity
grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of substantially the same types of equity
awards with substantially the same terms as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus awards. In
the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.
