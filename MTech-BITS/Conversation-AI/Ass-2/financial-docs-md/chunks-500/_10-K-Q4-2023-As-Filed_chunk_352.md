The Companyâ€™s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower
effective  tax  rate  on  foreign  earnings,  the  impact  of  the  U.S.  federal  R&D  credit,  and  tax  benefits  from  share-based
compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.
