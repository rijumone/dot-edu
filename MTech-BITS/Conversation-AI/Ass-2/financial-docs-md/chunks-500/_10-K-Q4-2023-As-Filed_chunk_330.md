The Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.

The  Company’s  total  net  sales  decreased  3%  or  $11.0  billion  during  2023  compared  to  2022.  The  weakness  in  foreign
currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  accounted  for  more  than  the  entire  year-over-year  decrease  in  total  net  sales,  which
consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.
