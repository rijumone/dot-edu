Greater China

Greater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to
the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily
of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone.
