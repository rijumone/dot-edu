Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669
million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying
foreign  currency  exposures,  which  were  excluded  from  the  assessment,  generally  offset  changes  in  the  fair  values  of  the
Company’s foreign currency derivatives.
