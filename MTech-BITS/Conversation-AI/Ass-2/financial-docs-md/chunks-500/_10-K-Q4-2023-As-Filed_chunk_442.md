Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To  protect  gross  margins  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  the  Company  may  use  forwards,  options  or  other
instruments,  and  may  designate  these  instruments  as  cash  flow  hedges.  The  Company  generally  hedges  portions  of  its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
