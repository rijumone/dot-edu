Engagement

The  Company  believes  that  open  and  honest  communication  among  team  members,  managers  and  leaders  helps  create  an
open,  collaborative  work  environment  where  everyone  can  contribute,  grow  and  succeed.  Team  members  are  encouraged  to
come  to  their  managers  with  questions,  feedback  or  concerns,  and  the  Company  conducts  surveys  that  gauge  employee
sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.
