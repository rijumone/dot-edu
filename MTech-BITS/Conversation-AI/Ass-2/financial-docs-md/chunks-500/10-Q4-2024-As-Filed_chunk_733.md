Covenants

The Indentures set forth limited covenants that apply to the Notes. However, these covenants do not, among

other things:

•

•

•

limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries;

limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens; or

restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming
our capital stock.
