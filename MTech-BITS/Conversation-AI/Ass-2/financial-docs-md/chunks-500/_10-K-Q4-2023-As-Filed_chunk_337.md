Europe

Europe net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to
the  U.S.  dollar  accounted  for  more  than  the  entire  year-over-year  decrease  in  Europe  net  sales,  which  consisted  primarily  of
lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services.
